Open Client Computer Management System (**openCCMSYS**). This is a web based computer management system which has been designed primarily for use by IT departments to help keep track of any hardware and license keys that they manage, although the system can be used by anyone to keep track of IT hardware and software licenses.

The system runs on a PHP and MySQL backend with a basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript front end. It is a non-complex system as it serves a very specific purpose and having little complexity helps keep focus and reduce bugs and the learning curve for the system.
