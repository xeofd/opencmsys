Open Client Computer Management System (**openCCMSYS**). This is a web based computer management system which has been designed primarily for use by IT departments to help keep track of any hardware and license keys that they manage, although the system can be used by anyone to keep track of IT hardware and software licenses.

The system runs on a PHP and MySQL backend with a basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript front end. It is a non-complex system as it serves a very specific purpose and having little complexity helps keep focus and reduce bugs and the learning curve for the system.

This GIT package also has a system for importing any data you may have, this is a simple Python program which recieves the location of your current data set, if you have some, and the current table headers to import them into the MySQL database.

## How to setup ##

For help getting the system set up please see SETUP.md, this will give you some instructions on how to download the repo, set up the database and if needed, use DIEapp to import your current data.

Alternativly you can visit <https://www.benfd.uk/projects/openccmsys/setup> to see a graphical version of setting up the system along with some videos.
